The babel is an Epitech project who's goal is to create a VoIP protocol and implement it in c++ using the following libraries:  
  
Qt (client side)  
Boost (server/client side)  
BoostAsio (server side)  
PortAudio (client side)  
Opus (client side)  
sqlite3 (server side)  
  
The project should be cross platform (windows/linux) and consists of a server and a client. The server connects clients between them and handle messages/commands,   but the voice communication should be done in p2p using udp between two clients.  
  
Usage : ./build.sh  
  
You will need conan, good luck.
