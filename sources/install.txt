Projects built this way will expect PortAudio to be installed on target systems in order to run.
If you want to build a more self-contained binary, you may use the libportaudio.a file:

cp lib/.libs/libportaudio.a /YOUR/PROJECT/DIR (je l'ai deja fait)

You may also need to copy portaudio.h (je l'ai deja fait), located in the include/ directory of PortAudio into your project.
Note that you will usually need to link with the appropriate libraries that you used, such as ALSA and JACK,
as well as with librt and libpthread. For example:

Compile line: gcc main.c libportaudio.a -lrt -lm -lasound -ljack -pthread -o YOUR_BINARY
